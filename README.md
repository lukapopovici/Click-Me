Small game made on the browser using Vanilla Javascript a bit of HTML5 and CSS. </br>Made for the purpose of learning Javascript and Web Development.

## The objective

The point of the game is to click on as many dots as you can before they run out. 
The duration of the game is based on the total number of dots that will appear on screen, that can be adjusted by changing the variable "dot_number" at the start of 
 [script.js](https://github.com/lukapopovici/Click-Me/blob/main/javascript/script.js).
